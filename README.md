I am an Environmental Engineer and Professor with a doctorate in Engineering, focusing on Environmental Technologies, and a postdoctoral degree in Natural Resources. My area of focus is Remote Sensing and Vegetation Analysis. I have practical experience in monitoring vegetation with multispectral and hyperspectral data, processing digital images from aerial and orbital sensors, and analyzing field spectroscopy data. A significant part of my work involves the application of these technologies to natural vegetation analysis and precision agriculture practices. I am interested in the potential of Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and its potential to revolutionize the field of Remote Sensing.

## Published Work
* [The Potential of Visual ChatGPT For Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13009) - This paper investigates the potential of Visual ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM) with image analysis capabilities, in the remote sensing domain. It can generate textual descriptions of images, perform edge detection and image segmentation. By applying these techniques to satellite image datasets, we expose the model's limitations but also foresee its transformative potential in remote sensing image processing.
 
* [A Review on Deep Learning in UAV Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10861) - This paper reviews the application of Deep Learning (DL) techniques in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based imagery, an area not yet deeply explored. We examine 232 papers featuring DL applications with UAV-acquired data, focusing on classification and regression techniques. Our findings underscore DL's promise in processing UAV-based image data, particularly within environmental, urban, and agricultural contexts. We also project future DL explorations in the UAV remote sensing field.
